1. Created a github repo, template.py, setup.py, logger, exception
2. Created a virtual env:
    > conda create -n stocks python=3.8 -y
    > conda activate stocks
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Performed below experiments in notebooks:
    > EDA.ipynb - Performed detailed EDA, visualization, moving average etc
    > xgboost.ipynb - Trained, evaluated and predicted using XGBOOST algorithm (Performed not good)
    > LSTM_GRU.ipynb - Trained, evaluated and predicted using (LSTM+GRU) algorithm (Performed better than xgboost)
    > GRU.ipynb - Trained, evaluated and predicted using GRU architecture (Performed decent)
